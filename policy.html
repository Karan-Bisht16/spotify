    <h1>Spotify policy</h1>
   <p>
    Subject to applicable law, you agree that your sole and exclusive remedy for any problems or dissatisfaction with the Spotify Service is to uninstall any Spotify software and to stop accessing the Spotify Service. You agree that Spotify has no obligation or liability arising from or related to third-party applications or the content thereof made available through or in connection with the Spotify Service, and while your relationship with such third-party applications may be governed by separate agreements with such third parties, your sole and exclusive remedy, as with respect to Spotify, for any problems or dissatisfaction with any third-party applications or the content thereof, is to uninstall or stop using such third-party applications.

**In no event will Spotify, its officers, shareholders, employees, agents, directors, subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, assigns, suppliers, or licensors be liable for (1) any indirect, special, incidental, punitive, exemplary, or consequential damages; (2) any loss of use, data, business, or profits (whether direct or indirect), in all cases arising out of the use of or inability to access the Spotify Service, devices, third-party applications, or third-party application content; or (3) aggregate liability for all claims relating to the Spotify Service, third-party applications, or third-party application content more than the greater of (a) the amounts paid by you to Spotify during the twelve months prior to the first claim; or (b) $30.00. Any liability we do have for losses you suffer is strictly limited to losses that were reasonably foreseeable. **

For clarification, these terms do not limit Spotify's liability for fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, death or personal injury to the extent that applicable law would prohibit such a limitation and for any other liability that, by applicable law, may not be limited or excluded.

**Except where such restriction is prohibited under applicable law, any claim arising under these terms must be commenced (by filing a demand for arbitration or filing an individual action under the arbitration agreement below) within one (1) year after the date the party asserting the claim first knows or reasonably should know of the act, omission, or default giving rise to the claim; and there shall be no right to any remedy for any claim not asserted within that time period. **
